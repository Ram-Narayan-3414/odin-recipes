    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> A bread omelette is a <strong> simple </strong> and <strong> easy </strong> to make breakfast or brunch dish. It is a great way to use up leftover bread and is a <em> delicious </em> and <em> nutritious </em> meal. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> 2 slices of bread </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> 2 Eggs </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Red onion, finely chopped </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Green bell pepper, finely chopped </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Spices (cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili powder, salt, pepper) </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Coriander leaves, chopped </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Slice of cheese </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Ketchup </strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> Step-by-step instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Into a bowl, crack open eggs and add in the <strong> cumin seeds, garam masala, red onion, bell pepper, red chili powder </strong> and add some <strong> salt </strong>. Mix well with a fork. </li>
        <li> Heat a pan over <em> medium heat </em> and pour in the egg mixture. Cook on <em> medium heat </em>. </li>
        <li> Dunk one side of each slice of bread in the egg mixture on the pan. Then flip the slide of bread and place <em> face down </em> into the egg mixture. </li>
        <li> Cook for <em> 1-2 minutes </em> until the bottom side is cooked. Flip the whole thing <strong> (omelette along with bread slices) </strong>. </li>
        <li> Place a slice of cheese, some chopped cilantro and fold the hanging flaps of the omelette inwards. Fold again so the two slices of bread are on top of each other. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Variations </h2>
    <p>This easy breakfast is one of the <strong> quickest </strong> ways to enjoy a quick and easy breakfast sandwich. The bread omelette recipe requires minimal ingredients, making it ideal for busy mornings. You can make variations of it based on what you have at home. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> Customise the Egg Mix </strong> – if you don’t have <em> bell peppers </em>, swap it with whatever veggies you have at home. You can also add other spice powders like <strong> tandoori masala, turmeric powder </strong>. </li>
        <li> <strong> Different Cheeses </strong> – I love to use <em> American Cheese </em> cause that type of cheese melts very easily. You can swap it for <strong> cheddar cheese </strong> or whatever you like. </li>
    </ul>
